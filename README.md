# Portfolio Website

This is a simple **portfolio website** built using **HTML** and **basic CSS**.  
It contains two main pages:

- **Home Page** – A brief introduction about me and my work.
- **Contact Page** – A simple form where visitors can reach out to me.

This project helped me practice the fundamentals of web development, including creating structured layouts with HTML and styling them using CSS.
